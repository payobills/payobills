## why create such an app?
- Help me with all my bill related needs - save time and pay bills together.
- Reminders about which bills I need to pay.
- Analytics from all my financial data, locally.

and... learning Kubernetes; contributing to the Self-Hosted open source community.

## project setup (headed towards this)
- Each microservice in a folder in `apps` directory
- A build system to help managing deployment and running the services
- Code reuse with packages
