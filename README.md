## Why create such an app?
- Help me with all my bill related needs; save time and pay bills together.
- Analytics from all my financial data, without exposing my data.
- Learning Kubernetes and tooling across the stack
- Contributing to the Self-Hosted open source community

## Project structure
- Each microservice in a folder in `apps` directory
- A build system to help managing deployment and running the services - uses [Please.Build](https://please.build) by [@thought-machine](https://github.com/thought-machine)
- Code reuse with packages

## Deployment
This project uses a sibling project I created [@mrsauravsahu/kube-homelab](https://github.com/mrsauravsahu/kube-homelab) to create a Kubernetes Cluster using Raspberry Pi nodes - more details on my [YouTube channel @mrsauravsahuin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfBcERF6qw4)
