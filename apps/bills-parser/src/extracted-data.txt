 Interest free (grace) period will not be applicable if any balance of the previous month's bill is outstanding, even if the Minimum

 Interest Illustration     
 Sample Interest Illustration 1: Assume that you have an American Express Credit Card, have paid the balance on your     
 previous statement in full and do not have any amount outstanding on your Card Account. Your statement date is the 1st of     
 every month. You made a purchase on 15th July for Rs.20,000 and on 19th July for Rs. 7,000. Your statement generated 1st     
 Aug will have a total outstanding of Rs. 27,000, with a minimum due of Rs.1,350. Assume that you have paid the Minimum Due     
 of Rs 1,350 on the Due Date of 22nd Aug and have made an additional purchase of Rs. 4000 on 28th Aug. In the statement     
 generated 1st Sep, the total outstanding will be Rs.29,650. With an illustrative interest rate of 3.5% p.m., the interest     
 calculation will be as follows:     
 1. Interest on Rs. 20,000, from 15th July – 18th July (4 days) = Rs. 92.05     
 2. Interest on Rs.27,000 from 19th July – 1st Aug (14 days) = Rs.434.96     
 3. Interest on Rs.27,000 from 2nd Aug – 21st Aug (20 days) = Rs. 621.37     
 4. Interest on Rs.25,650 from 22nd Aug – 27th Aug (6 days) = Rs. 177.09     
 5. Interest on Rs. 29,650 from 28th Aug – 1st Sep (5 days) = Rs. 170.59     
 Thus, the total interest charged will be Rs.1496 (exclusive of applicable taxes).     
 Sample Interest Illustration 2: Assume that you have an American Express Credit Card, have paid the balance on your     
 previous statement in full and do not have any amount outstanding on your Card Account. Your statement date is the 1st of     
 every month. You have been charged the Annual Fee on your card of Rs.5000 on 1st May and applicable taxes of Rs.900 on 1st     
 May. Your statement generated on 1st May will have a total outstanding of Rs.5,900 and a minimum due amount of Rs.5,900.     
 Assume you have not paid the Minimum Due by 22nd May, and made another purchase on 29th May for Rs. 2,000. With an     
 illustrative interest rate of 3.5% p.m., the interest calculation for the statement generated 1st June will be as follows:     
 1. Interest on Rs. 2,000, from 29th May – 1st June (4 days) = Rs. 9.21     
 2. LPC @ 30% of Rs. 5900 (subject to a minimum of Rs. 500 and maximum of Rs. 1000) = Rs.1000     
 Thus, the total interest charged will be Rs. 9.21 (exclusive of applicable taxes).

 Sample Interest Illustration 2: Assume that you have an American Express Credit Card, have paid the balance on your     
 previous statement in full and do not have any amount outstanding on your Card Account. Your statement date is the 1st of     
 every month. You have been charged the Annual Fee on your card of Rs.5000 on 1st May and applicable taxes of Rs.900 on 1st     
 May. Your statement generated on 1st May will have a total outstanding of Rs.5,900 and a minimum due amount of Rs.5,900.     
 Assume you have not paid the Minimum Due by 22nd May, and made another purchase on 29th May for Rs. 2,000. With an     
 illustrative interest rate of 3.5% p.m., the interest calculation for the statement generated 1st June will be as follows:     
 1. Interest on Rs. 2,000, from 29th May – 1st June (4 days) = Rs. 9.21     
 2. LPC @ 30% of Rs. 5900 (subject to a minimum of Rs. 500 and maximum of Rs. 1000) = Rs.1000     
 Thus, the total interest charged will be Rs. 9.21 (exclusive of applicable taxes).
