# SvelteKit PWA: Offline MVP Plan

> Scope: Minimal implementation to enable the app shell to load offline. The app will initially load with an empty state (no cached data). No code—only a plan.

---

## 1) Objectives & Non‑Goals

**Objectives**
- [ ] Serve the app shell offline so the app always loads, even without network.

**Non‑Goals (MVP)**
- [ ] No caching of API responses or dynamic data.
- [ ] No IndexedDB storage, background sync, or write queue.
- [ ] No push notifications in this release.
- [ ] No nice‑to‑have enhancements (navigation preload, badging, etc.).

---

## 2) Web Platform Capabilities (MVP only)

- [ ] **Service Worker (SW):** Install/activate lifecycle; precache app shell.
- [ ] **Cache Storage API:** Used only for precaching static build assets.
- [ ] **Web App Manifest:** Basic PWA installability (icons, start URL, display mode).

---

## 3) Architecture Overview (MVP target)

**App Shell**
- [ ] Precache build assets (HTML shell, JS/CSS chunks, fonts).
- [ ] When offline, always serve the shell. App shows empty state by design.

---

## 4) SvelteKit Integration Strategy (MVP)

- [ ] **Service Worker**: Single SW module, precaches build assets only.
- [ ] **SW Registration**: Registered from app only in production builds.
- [ ] **App Behavior**: If offline, app loads shell with no data (empty state).

---

## 5) Permissions & Security (MVP)

- [ ] HTTPS required.
- [ ] Narrow SW scope to app root.
- [ ] Cache versioning to avoid stale assets.

---

## 6) Rollout Plan (Phased MVP)

**Phase 1 – App Shell Offline**
- [ ] Configure SW to precache build assets.
- [ ] Verify offline load works (empty state displayed).

---

## 7) Testing & Verification

- [ ] Test offline load: clear cache, simulate offline, reload → app shell loads.
- [ ] Validate SW lifecycle (install, activate, update).
- [ ] Run Lighthouse PWA audit for offline capability.
