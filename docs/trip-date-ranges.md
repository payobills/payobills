# Trip Date Ranges

## Context

Trips already exist in the system as `TransactionTag` — a tag you can attach to individual transactions. The tag appears on the transaction edit page, and the trips list page shows all transactions tagged with a given trip.

The missing piece: **no date range is attached to a trip**. You can't say "I was in Europe from May 1 to May 15" and then see all transactions that happened in that window — you'd have to tag each one manually. This feature adds start/end dates to trips, enabling two things:

1. A "trip view" that pulls transactions by date range (not just by manual tag)
2. A context hint for the SLM parser: when parsing a transaction whose date falls inside a trip's range, inject the trip context into the prompt to boost parsing confidence

---

## Goal

- Add `StartDate` / `EndDate` to trips
- UI for setting dates when creating or editing a trip
- Trip detail page shows all transactions within the date range (in addition to manually tagged ones)
- Transaction parser injects active-trip context when a transaction's date falls inside a trip window

---

## Data Model

Trips are currently stored as multi-select column options on the `Transactions` table in NocoDB — just strings. That format cannot hold metadata like dates.

A new **`Trips`** table in NocoDB is needed:

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Id` | Auto-increment int | Primary key |
| `Title` | Text | Must match the tag string on Transactions (used as the link) |
| `StartDate` | Date | Inclusive |
| `EndDate` | Date | Inclusive |
| `CreatedAt` | DateTime | Auto |
| `UpdatedAt` | DateTime | Auto |

The existing `Tags` multi-select column on `Transactions` is unchanged. The `Title` in the `Trips` table is the join key — a transaction tagged "Europe 2025" links to the `Trips` row whose title is "Europe 2025". This keeps backwards compatibility and avoids migrating the tag column.

---

## Architecture

```
UI (SvelteKit)
  ├─ /trips            → list trips with date ranges
  ├─ /trips/new        → create trip (title + date pickers)
  ├─ /trips/:id/edit   → edit trip dates
  └─ /trips/:id        → show transactions in date range ∪ tagged transactions

GraphQL API (C# HotChocolate)
  ├─ Query: trips { id title startDate endDate }
  ├─ Mutation: tripCreate(input) → Trip
  └─ Mutation: tripUpdate(id, input) → Trip

NocoDB
  ├─ Trips table (new)
  └─ Transactions.Tags column (unchanged)

Transaction Parser (Rust)
  └─ trips_store.rs (new)
       → fetch active trips for a transaction date
       → inject trip context into SLM prompt
```

## Components

### 1. NocoDB — `Trips` table

Create the table via the NocoDB UI or API before wiring backend code. The `Title` column is the link to the existing tag system. If a trip has no date range yet (legacy data), `StartDate` and `EndDate` can be null — the row still acts as metadata for the tag.

### 2. Backend — C# service

**New DTO:**
```csharp
public record TripDTO(string Id, string Title, DateTime? StartDate, DateTime? EndDate);
public record TripCreateOrUpdateDTO(string Title, DateTime? StartDate, DateTime? EndDate);
```

**`TripsNocoDBService`** — mirrors the existing `TransactionsNocoDBService` pattern:
- `GetTripsAsync()` — fetch all rows from `Trips` table
- `GetTripByIdAsync(id)` — fetch single row
- `CreateTripAsync(input)` — insert row
- `UpdateTripAsync(id, input)` — patch row

**GraphQL additions in `Query.cs` / `Mutation.cs`:**
```csharp
// Query
public async Task<IEnumerable<TripDTO>> Trips([Service] TripsNocoDBService svc)
    => await svc.GetTripsAsync();

// Mutations
public async Task<TripDTO> TripCreate(TripCreateOrUpdateDTO input, [Service] TripsNocoDBService svc)
    => await svc.CreateTripAsync(input);

public async Task<TripDTO> TripUpdate(string id, TripCreateOrUpdateDTO input, [Service] TripsNocoDBService svc)
    => await svc.UpdateTripAsync(id, input);
```

**`transactions` query** — extend `TransactionFiltersInput` to support date-range filtering:
```csharp
public record TransactionFiltersInput(
    IEnumerable<string>? Tags,
    DateTime? FromDate,   // new
    DateTime? ToDate      // new
);
```

The NocoDB query for date range uses the existing `where` filter syntax with `BackDate` column.

### 3. Frontend — SvelteKit

**Type update:**
```typescript
export type Trip = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  startDate: Date | null;
  endDate: Date | null;
};
```

**Trip list page (`/trips`)** — add date range display on trip cards:
```
Europe 2025
May 1 – May 15, 2025
```

**Trip create/edit form** — add two date inputs (`startDate`, `endDate`). Both optional so existing trips without dates keep working.

**Trip detail page (`/trips/:id`)** — change the query strategy:
- If trip has `startDate`/`endDate`: query `transactions(filters: { fromDate, toDate })` and merge with tagged transactions, deduplicating by id
- If no date range: fall back to current tag-only query

Show a visual indicator on each transaction: "in date range" vs "manually tagged" vs both.

### 4. Transaction Parser — Rust

New file **`trips_store.rs`** in `apps/transaction-parser/src/payobills/`:

```rust
pub struct TripContext {
    pub title: String,
    pub start_date: NaiveDate,
    pub end_date: NaiveDate,
}

pub async fn get_active_trips_for_date(
    client: &NocoDBClient,
    date: NaiveDate,
) -> anyhow::Result<Vec<TripContext>>
```

This fetches all trips from NocoDB and filters to those whose `[StartDate, EndDate]` window contains `date`. If the transaction's `BackDate` is not yet parsed, this step is skipped.

**Prompt injection in `slm_client.rs`:**

The existing prompt asks the SLM to extract regex patterns from raw SMS text. When trip context is available, append a note:

```
Additional context: The user was on a trip titled "{title}" during this transaction 
(trip dates: {start_date} to {end_date}). Use this to resolve ambiguous merchant 
locations or currencies.
```

This is appended to the existing `generate_regex` prompt. The SLM receives it as soft context — it can use it to bias currency selection (e.g. EUR over INR for a Europe trip) without changing the output format (the regex + fields JSON stays the same).

## Implementation Sequence

1. **Create `Trips` table in NocoDB** — manually, with Id/Title/StartDate/EndDate columns
2. **Backend: `TripsNocoDBService` + DTOs** — CRUD against the new table
3. **Backend: GraphQL `trips` query + `tripCreate`/`tripUpdate` mutations**
4. **Backend: extend `TransactionFiltersInput`** with `fromDate`/`toDate`, wire to NocoDB query
5. **Frontend: update `Trip` type** — add startDate/endDate fields
6. **Frontend: trip create/edit form** — date pickers, call `tripCreate`/`tripUpdate`
7. **Frontend: trip list page** — display date range on cards
8. **Frontend: trip detail page** — merge date-range query with tag query
9. **Parser: `trips_store.rs`** — fetch active trips for a date
10. **Parser: inject trip context in `slm_client.rs`** — append context note to prompt when trips found

Steps 1–4 can be done in one PR. Steps 5–8 in a second. Step 9–10 as a third, since it depends on the NocoDB trips table being populated with real data.

## Open Questions

- **Overlap handling:** if a transaction falls in two trip date ranges (e.g. a stopover), inject context for both trips in the prompt, separated by newline.
- **Trip edit UI placement:** add an edit button on the trip detail page rather than a separate `/trips/:id/edit` route — keeps navigation simple.
- **Tag auto-suggestion:** when a transaction's date falls inside a trip range, the UI could suggest adding the trip tag automatically. Out of scope for this phase.
- **Existing `transactionTags` query:** keep it alongside the new `trips` query during transition. `transactionTags` reads from NocoDB column meta; `trips` reads from the `Trips` table. Reconcile titles manually if there are mismatches.
